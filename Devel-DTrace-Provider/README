Devel-DTrace-Provider version 0.01
==================================

This is a Perl port of "ruby-dtrace", bindings for the probe and 
consumer APIs of DTrace. 

What works:

  * DOF generation and loading
  * Firing probes directly, with arguments
  * Probes exposed as subs in their own namespace

To do / to test:

  * Is-enabled checks

This is enough to be useful, though doesn't minimise the disabled
probe effect, and provides no way run code to gather probe arguments
only when the probe is enabled.
  
INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Requires DTrace support on your platform, and initially is only 
targetting i386.
